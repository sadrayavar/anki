# Anki Resources
This repository is a collection of resources related to Anki, a powerful flashcard app.

I'm sharing these resources in the hope that they can enhance your learning process. Anki allows you to learn anything you like with minimal effort and retain it for the long term (even lifetime).

"Anki is a program that makes remembering things easy. Because it's much more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either significantly decrease your study time or significantly increase the amount you learn."
