# Audio
I'm currently using the [AwesomeTTS](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1436550454) add-on to generate audio that sounds the same across all platforms regardless of the built-in Text-to-Speech engine.

If you're interested in how I achieved this, you can visit [this](https://www.vocab.ai/tutorials/awesometts-batch-generation) tutorial from AwesomeTTS Add-on.
