# Usage
Due to its incompleteness, this note type currently lacks the template.apkg file. However, you can download the styleless version and then copy and paste the CSS and HTML of cards into the note type manager within Anki.

# Figma
Thank [Zahra Rostami](https://github.com/zahraRostami1999)'s collabration, we now have a Figma design for this project. You can see it [here](https://www.figma.com/design/zpehWOS4BjJM6ByK3JW3Er/Anki?node-id=0-1&t=UTmwWL7EzuFoYv6i-1).

# Compatibility
I'm currently working on the desktop version, but I plan to start working on the mobile styling after finishing this project.
